# Charity_Analysis\
##Overview
  The purpose of this analysis is to beable to process data, extract the data and fit a model so that a neural network can attempt to interpret the data and make predictions
  
## Results
  * Data Preprocessing: The target variables that we wanted to use was the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" feature, which is what we wanted to predict for the success rate of the charity data
  * The features for my neural network model is the APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION in order to determine the integrity of the charity organization
  * During the processing, I had to remove STATUS, INCOME_AMOUNT, as well as  SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS because they did not assist us in the assessment.
